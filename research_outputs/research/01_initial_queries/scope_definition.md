# Scope Definition

This research aims to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study and gather best practices for the AgriConnect project, as detailed in the User Blueprint ([`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)). The primary focus is on addressing key technical and operational challenges to inform the project's planning, specification, and architectural design phases.

The research will specifically investigate the following five core areas:

1.  **Local Commodity Price Data Integration:**
    *   Identifying sources for real-time or frequently updated local commodity price data.
    *   Assessing the relevance and coverage of these sources for diverse Indian agricultural markets.
    *   Evaluating methods for integrating this data into the AgriConnect platform.
    *   Considering data formats, update frequencies, and API availability.

2.  **Multilingual Support in Next.js:**
    *   Best practices for implementing robust multilingual support (UI and content) in a Next.js application.
    *   Strategies for catering to multiple Indian languages (e.g., Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, and English as per PRD).
    *   Addressing usability for users with varying levels of digital literacy.
    *   Exploring i18n libraries and content management strategies for translations.

3.  **Localized Crop Advisory and Post-Harvest Guidance:**
    *   Identifying reliable and accessible sources or existing platforms for localized crop advisory information (pests, diseases, climate adaptation).
    *   Finding sources for post-harvest guidance suitable for small-scale Indian farmers.
    *   Evaluating the quality, relevance, and accessibility of content from these sources.
    *   Considering methods for integrating or curating this information within AgriConnect.

4.  **Web Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA):**
    *   Best practices and practical techniques for ensuring web accessibility, targeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
    *   Specific considerations for users with low literacy levels.
    *   Strategies for users with potentially inconsistent internet access (e.g., lightweight design, offline considerations as mentioned in PRD).
    *   Tools and testing methodologies for accessibility.

5.  **Data Privacy and Security for Farmer Data:**
    *   Best practices for handling sensitive user data of Indian farmers.
    *   Considerations for relevant Indian data protection regulations (e.g., Digital Personal Data Protection Act).
    *   Techniques for building user trust regarding data privacy.
    *   Security measures applicable to the specified tech stack (Next.js, Supabase).

**Out of Scope for this Research Phase (unless directly informing the above):**
*   Detailed UI/UX design beyond accessibility and multilingual considerations.
*   Specific vendor selection for paid services, unless a particular vendor is a unique source for critical data/functionality.
*   Implementation of features beyond the feasibility and best practice gathering.
*   Full legal review of data protection regulations (high-level considerations will be included).
*   Marketplace transaction mechanics or payment gateway integration (as per PRD, not in MVP).

The findings will be documented in a structured manner to support subsequent project development phases.
