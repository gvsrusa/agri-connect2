# Key Research Questions

This document lists the key questions that this research aims to answer, categorized by the core research areas defined in the [`scope_definition.md`](research_outputs/research/01_initial_queries/scope_definition.md).

## 1. Local Commodity Price Data Integration

*   What are the primary public and private sources for real-time or frequently updated local commodity price data across diverse Indian agricultural markets (mandis)?
    *   Examples: Agmarknet, eNAM, state agricultural marketing boards, private data providers.
*   How reliable, accurate, and comprehensive is the data from these sources?
    *   What is the typical update frequency (e.g., daily, hourly)?
    *   What is the geographical coverage (national, state, district, specific mandis)?
    *   Are there known issues with data quality or consistency?
*   What are the common data formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML, API access) provided by these sources?
*   What are the technical requirements and best practices for integrating these data sources into a Next.js application using Supabase as the backend?
    *   Are there APIs available? What are their rate limits, authentication methods, and costs (if any)?
    *   How can data be efficiently fetched, stored, and updated in Supabase?
*   How can price data be localized effectively (e.g., commodity names in regional languages, local units of measurement)?
*   What are the potential challenges in sourcing and maintaining this data (e.g., data gaps, changes in source availability, data normalization)?

## 2. Multilingual Support in Next.js

*   What are the leading i18n (internationalization) libraries and frameworks compatible with Next.js for managing UI and content translations?
    *   Examples: `next-i18next`, `react-i18next`, `next-intl`.
    *   What are their pros and cons regarding ease of use, performance, community support, and feature set (e.g., pluralization, date/number formatting)?
*   What are best practices for structuring translatable content (UI strings, dynamic content from database) within a Next.js application?
    *   How should language preferences be stored and managed for users (as per PRD, in user profile)?
    *   How to handle SEO for multilingual sites?
*   What strategies are effective for managing the translation workflow for multiple Indian languages (e.g., Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, English)?
    *   Use of translation management systems (TMS)?
    *   Working with human translators vs. machine translation (with review)?
*   How can the UI/UX be designed to be user-friendly for individuals with varying digital literacy, especially when switching and using different languages?
    *   Clear language switchers, visual cues, font considerations for Indian scripts.
*   What are common pitfalls or challenges in implementing multilingual support for Indian languages (e.g., font rendering, text expansion/contraction, complex script requirements)?

## 3. Localized Crop Advisory and Post-Harvest Guidance

*   What are authoritative and reliable sources for localized crop advisory information in India?
    *   Government bodies (e.g., ICAR, KVKs, State Agricultural Universities).
    *   NGOs, research institutions, private agri-tech companies.
    *   Are there existing platforms or APIs that provide this information?
*   What types of content are most effective for small-scale farmers (e.g., concise text, images, simple videos, audio)?
    *   How can this content be adapted for users with low literacy?
*   How can crop advisory information be effectively localized for different agro-climatic zones, crop types, and regional languages within India?
*   What are reliable sources for post-harvest handling and storage guidance relevant to common Indian crops and small-scale farming contexts?
*   What are the best practices for curating, structuring, and presenting this information within the AgriConnect application in multiple languages?
    *   How to ensure content is up-to-date and accurate?
*   Are there successful examples of digital platforms delivering such advisory services in India that can serve as models?

## 4. Web Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

*   What are the key principles and practical techniques for achieving WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance in a Next.js and Tailwind CSS application?
*   What specific accessibility considerations are crucial for users with low literacy levels?
    *   Simple language, clear navigation, use of icons/visuals, avoiding jargon.
*   How can web accessibility be ensured for users with inconsistent or low-bandwidth internet access?
    *   Performance optimization, progressive enhancement, ARIA attributes for dynamic content.
    *   Offline access strategies for cached content (as per PRD).
*   What tools and methodologies are recommended for testing web accessibility throughout the development lifecycle?
    *   Automated checkers, manual testing techniques, screen reader testing.
*   What are common accessibility challenges encountered with multilingual websites, especially those using Indian scripts, and how can they be addressed?
*   How can Tailwind CSS be leveraged effectively to build accessible components? Are there any known limitations or best practices?

## 5. Data Privacy and Security for Farmer Data

*   What are the key provisions of India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) relevant to the AgriConnect application and its handling of farmer data (name, contact, location, preferences)?
*   What are the best practices for data minimization, consent management, and purpose limitation when collecting and processing user data?
*   What technical security measures should be implemented in a Next.js (frontend) and Supabase (PostgreSQL backend) architecture to protect sensitive user data?
    *   Authentication (Clerk/NextAuth as per PRD), authorization, data encryption (at rest and in transit), secure API design.
    *   Preventing common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection).
*   How can user trust be built regarding data privacy and security, especially among a user base that may be new to digital platforms or have concerns about data misuse?
    *   Clear privacy policies (in local languages), transparent data usage statements, user control over data.
*   What are the best practices for secure management of localization strings and translated content, especially if it involves user-generated or sensitive information?
*   Are there specific security considerations for data sourced from third-party APIs (e.g., commodity prices, advisory content)?
