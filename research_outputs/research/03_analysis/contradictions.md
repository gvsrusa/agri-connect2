# Contradictions and Discrepancies

This document notes any contradictions, discrepancies, or conflicting information found during the research.

## 1. Local Commodity Price Data Integration

*   **Potential Discrepancy**: While eNAM aims for real-time data, the actual reflection of prices accessible via API versus prices observed locally in non-eNAM or less digitized mandis might differ. The extent of "real-time" may vary.
*   **Potential Discrepancy**: Some private data providers claim highly granular and real-time data, but the methodology for collection and verification might not always be transparent, potentially leading to discrepancies when compared with public data or actual transaction prices.

## 2. Multilingual Support in Next.js

*   **No Major Contradictions Noted Yet**: Best practices for i18n seem relatively consistent across sources. Specific library choices depend on project needs (App Router vs. Pages Router, complexity).

## 3. Localized Crop Advisory and Post-Harvest Guidance

*   **Potential Discrepancy**: The effectiveness of purely digital advisory (app/SMS-based) versus hybrid models (digital + human extension) can be debated. While digital scales, the "last-mile" trust and adoption often benefit from human interface, especially for low-literacy users. Some platforms emphasize tech-first, others a blended approach.
*   **Potential Discrepancy**: Quality and reliability of advisory content from various sources (government, private, NGO) can vary. Some may be generic, while others are highly localized and research-backed.

## 4. Web Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

*   **No Major Contradictions Noted Yet**: WCAG guidelines are standardized. The challenge lies in consistent and thorough implementation, especially for dynamic content and custom components.

## 5. Data Privacy and Security for Farmer Data

*   **Potential Nuance (Not a direct contradiction)**: While DPDPA 2023 provides a framework, the practical interpretation and enforcement of certain clauses (e.g., "reasonable security safeguards," extent of data minimization for complex analytics) might evolve.
*   **Potential Challenge**: Balancing robust security measures with ease of use for farmers with low digital literacy. Highly complex security protocols could hinder usability if not implemented thoughtfully.
