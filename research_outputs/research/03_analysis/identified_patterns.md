# Identified Patterns

This document outlines patterns and recurring themes identified from the data collected in the [`02_data_collection`](research_outputs/research/02_data_collection/) phase.

## 1. Local Commodity Price Data Integration

*   **(Pattern)** Multiple government sources (Agmarknet, eNAM, SAMBs) exist, but data accessibility (API vs. downloads), update frequency, and reliability are inconsistent.
*   **(Pattern)** Private agri-tech startups are emerging as sources of more real-time or value-added price data, often with subscription costs or limited geographical focus.
*   **(Pattern)** A common challenge is data standardization (formats, commodity naming, units) across different sources.
*   **(Pattern)** Digitization levels vary significantly across states, impacting the quality and timeliness of data from SAMBs.

## 2. Multilingual Support in Next.js

*   **(Pattern)** `next-i18next` and `next-intl` are common library choices for i18n in Next.js, leveraging JSON files for translations.
*   **(Pattern)** Best practices include locale-based routing, `hreflang` tags for SEO, and careful management of translation files.
*   **(Pattern)** Indian language support requires specific attention to font rendering, text expansion in UI, and clear language switching mechanisms.
*   **(Pattern)** Designing for varying digital literacy involves simplified language, visual cues, and intuitive navigation, irrespective of the language.

## 3. Localized Crop Advisory and Post-Harvest Guidance

*   **(Pattern)** A mix of government institutions (ICAR, KVKs, SAUs, mKisan) and private platforms (BharatAgri, Farmonaut) provide advisory content.
*   **(Pattern)** Effective localization involves multilingual content (text, audio, visual), region-specific advice, and use of accessible channels like SMS and IVR.
*   **(Pattern)** Successful platforms often combine digital tools with on-ground support or partnerships for last-mile delivery.
*   **(Pattern)** Content typically covers pest/disease management, climate adaptation, and increasingly, post-harvest handling and market linkages.
*   **(Pattern)** Key challenges include digital literacy, internet connectivity, and ensuring content trustworthiness and relevance.

## 4. Web Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

*   **(Pattern)** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance involves addressing all four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust.
*   **(Pattern)** For low literacy users, simplified language, clear navigation, and visual aids are paramount, complementing technical WCAG criteria.
*   **(Pattern)** For inconsistent internet, PWA features (offline caching via service workers), image optimization (`next/image`), and code splitting are common technical solutions.
*   **(Pattern)** Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard accessibility, and sufficient color contrast are recurring technical requirements.
*   **(Pattern)** Testing involves a combination of automated tools (Axe, Lighthouse) and manual methods (keyboard navigation, screen readers).

## 5. Data Privacy and Security for Farmer Data

*   **(Pattern)** India's DPDPA 2023 mandates explicit consent, data minimization, user rights (access, correction, erasure), and security safeguards.
*   **(Pattern)** For the specified tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Clerk/NextAuth), RLS in Supabase is a key mechanism for data segregation and access control.
*   **(Pattern)** Authentication (Clerk/NextAuth) and encryption (HTTPS, at-rest encryption in Supabase) are fundamental security measures.
*   **(Pattern)** Building user trust requires transparency (clear privacy policies in local languages) and user control over their data.
*   **(Pattern)** Secure coding practices, input validation, and regular dependency updates are essential for mitigating vulnerabilities.
