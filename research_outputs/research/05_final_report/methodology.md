# Methodology

This research employed a multi-stage approach:

1.  **Initialization and Scoping**: Reviewed the AgriConnect User Blueprint ([`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)) and defined the research scope, key questions, and potential information sources.
2.  **Initial Data Collection**: Conducted broad research queries using Perplexity AI, focusing on the five core research areas. Findings were documented in [`research_outputs/research/02_data_collection/primary_findings_part1.md`](research_outputs/research/02_data_collection/primary_findings_part1.md) and [`research_outputs/research/02_data_collection/primary_findings_part2.md`](research_outputs/research/02_data_collection/primary_findings_part2.md).
3.  **First Pass Analysis and Gap Identification**: Analyzed collected data to identify patterns ([`research_outputs/research/03_analysis/identified_patterns.md`](research_outputs/research/03_analysis/identified_patterns.md)), contradictions ([`research_outputs/research/03_analysis/contradictions.md`](research_outputs/research/03_analysis/contradictions.md)), and critical knowledge gaps ([`research_outputs/research/03_analysis/critical_knowledge_gaps.md`](research_outputs/research/03_analysis/critical_knowledge_gaps.md)).
4.  **Targeted Research Cycles**: Conducted focused Perplexity AI queries to address specific knowledge gaps. Findings were integrated into the primary findings documents, and the knowledge gaps document was updated. (Two such cycles were completed in this operational phase).
5.  **Synthesis and Final Report Generation**: This stage involves synthesizing all findings into a cohesive report. Due to operational constraints, this report represents the outcomes of the initial research cycles.

The research process is designed to be iterative. Further targeted research cycles would be necessary to fully address all identified knowledge gaps.

*(This section will be expanded with more detail upon completion of all research cycles.)*
