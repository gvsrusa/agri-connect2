# High-Level Acceptance Test: HLT_002_User_Signup_Login

## 1. Test ID
HLT_002

## 2. Description
This test verifies that a new user can successfully sign up for an AgriConnect account and an existing user can log in using Clerk/NextAuth. The authentication interface elements (labels, buttons, messages) should be displayed in the user's selected language. This covers the authentication requirements from [`PRD.md:15`](docs/PRD.md:15) and [`PRD.md:59`](docs/PRD.md:59).

## 3. Preconditions
*   The AgriConnect web application is deployed and accessible in a test environment.
*   Clerk/NextAuth integration is functional for user authentication.
*   The application supports language selection, and UI elements related to authentication are translatable.
*   For the login part of the test, a pre-existing user account is available.
*   For the signup part, an unused email address/phone number is available.

## 4. Steps

### 4.1. User Signup
1.  **Navigate to Application:** Open a web browser and navigate to the AgriConnect application's home page.
2.  **Select Language (e.g., Hindi):** Use the language switcher to select a non-default language (e.g., Hindi). Verify UI updates.
3.  **Initiate Signup:** Click on the "Sign Up" or equivalent button (label should be in Hindi).
4.  **Enter Signup Details:** On the Clerk/NextAuth signup form (which should also respect language choice if possible, or be clearly understandable):
    *   Provide a unique email address or phone number.
    *   Provide a strong password.
    *   Complete any other required fields (e.g., name).
5.  **Submit Signup Form:** Click the "Sign Up" or "Register" button (label in selected language or clear).
6.  **Complete Verification (if any):** If email/phone verification is required, complete the verification step.
7.  **Verify Successful Signup:** Observe if the user is redirected to a post-signup page (e.g., dashboard, profile setup) and a success message (in selected language) is displayed.
8.  **Verify User in Database (Indirect):** Confirm user creation by attempting to log in with the new credentials later or by checking for user-specific elements on the dashboard.

### 4.2. User Logout
9.  **Locate Logout Option:** Find the "Logout" or equivalent option (label in selected language) in the user menu or profile section.
10. **Perform Logout:** Click the "Logout" button.
11. **Verify Successful Logout:** Confirm the user is redirected to the home page or login page, and session-specific elements are no longer visible.

### 4.3. User Login
12. **Navigate to Login Page:** Open the application or navigate to the login page. If not already on it, click the "Login" or equivalent button (label in selected language, e.g., Hindi).
13. **Enter Login Credentials:** On the Clerk/NextAuth login form (UI in selected language or clear):
    *   Enter the email address/phone number of a pre-existing or newly created user.
    *   Enter the corresponding password.
14. **Submit Login Form:** Click the "Login" or "Sign In" button (label in selected language or clear).
15. **Verify Successful Login:** Observe if the user is redirected to a post-login page (e.g., dashboard) and user-specific information is visible.

## 5. Expected Results

*   **ER1 (Signup):** A new user can successfully complete the signup process, including verification if applicable.
*   **ER2 (Signup Language):** Signup form labels and messages are displayed in the selected language (e.g., Hindi), or are clear and universally understandable if Clerk/NextAuth UI has limitations.
*   **ER3 (Signup Success Indication):** After successful signup, the user is redirected appropriately, and a success message (in the selected language) is shown.
*   **ER4 (Logout):** A logged-in user can successfully log out of the application.
*   **ER5 (Logout Indication):** After logout, the user is returned to a non-authenticated state (e.g., login page or public home page).
*   **ER6 (Login):** An existing user can successfully log in with valid credentials.
*   **ER7 (Login Language):** Login form labels and messages are displayed in the selected language (e.g., Hindi), or are clear.
*   **ER8 (Login Success Indication):** After successful login, the user is redirected to an authenticated area (e.g., dashboard), and user-specific elements are visible.

## 6. AI Verifiable Outcome

*   **AIVO1 (Signup Form Language):** AI verifies that key labels on the signup form (e.g., "Email", "Password", "Sign Up" button) are in the selected language (e.g., Hindi) by checking `innerText` or `textContent`.
*   **AIVO2 (Signup Success Navigation):** AI verifies redirection to an expected post-signup URL (e.g., `/dashboard`) and the presence of a success message element containing text in the selected language.
*   **AIVO3 (Logout Success):** AI verifies redirection to an expected post-logout URL (e.g., `/login` or `/`) and the absence of authenticated-session-only UI elements.
*   **AIVO4 (Login Form Language):** AI verifies that key labels on the login form are in the selected language.
*   **AIVO5 (Login Success Navigation & Element Presence):** AI verifies redirection to an expected post-login URL (e.g., `/dashboard`) and the presence of a known UI element only visible to logged-in users (e.g., "My Profile" link, "Logout" button in the selected language).

**Verification Method:** AI interacts with the browser DOM to input data into forms, click buttons, and inspect element text/attributes. It checks URLs after actions and looks for presence/absence of specific elements or text content in the expected language. For Clerk/NextAuth, AI might need to handle iframe interactions if the forms are embedded.
