# High-Level Acceptance Test: HLT_010_Submit_Feedback

## 1. Test ID
HLT_010

## 2. Description
This test verifies that a user (logged in, or anonymous if allowed) can submit comments or ratings on the web applicationâ€™s usability and content via a feedback form. The form interface should be in the selected language, and a confirmation should be provided. This covers the requirement from [`PRD.md:23`](docs/PRD.md:23).

## 3. Preconditions
*   The AgriConnect web application is deployed and accessible.
*   The "Submit Feedback" feature is implemented with a web form.
*   The application supports language selection, and UI elements for the feedback form are translatable.
*   Supabase database is connected and writable for storing user feedback.
*   User may or may not be logged in, depending on design (PRD implies general feedback). Assume for this test it's accessible without login, but links to user if logged in.

## 4. Steps

1.  **Navigate to Application:** Open a web browser and navigate to the AgriConnect application's home page.
2.  **Select Language (e.g., English):** Ensure the desired language (e.g., English, as a baseline) is selected.
3.  **Navigate to Feedback Form:**
    *   Locate and click on the "Feedback" or "Contact Us" or equivalent link/button (label in selected language). This might be in the footer or a main menu.
4.  **Observe Form Language:** Verify that labels, instructions, and button text on the feedback form are in the selected language (English).
5.  **Fill Feedback Form:** Enter valid details:
    *   **Name (Optional/If Anonymous):** Enter a name or leave blank if allowed.
    *   **Email (Optional/If Anonymous):** Enter an email or leave blank if allowed.
    *   **Rating (if applicable):** Select a rating (e.g., stars, scale).
    *   **Comments/Message:** Enter textual feedback (e.g., "The marketplace is very easy to use.").
6.  **Submit Feedback Form:** Click the "Submit Feedback" or equivalent button (label in selected language).
7.  **Verify Confirmation Message:** Observe if a success confirmation message is displayed in the selected language (e.g., "Thank you for your feedback!").
8.  **Verify Data in Supabase (Indirect/Conceptual):** Conceptually, the submitted feedback should now exist in the `user_feedback` table in Supabase. This is indirectly verified by the confirmation message.

## 5. Expected Results

*   **ER1:** The feedback form is accessible, and its labels/instructions are in the selected language.
*   **ER2:** The user can successfully fill and submit the feedback form.
*   **ER3:** Upon successful submission, a confirmation message is displayed in the selected language.
*   **ER4:** The feedback data is correctly persisted in the backend database (Supabase).
*   **ER5:** If the user is logged in, the feedback should be associated with their user ID in the database.

## 6. AI Verifiable Outcome

*   **AIVO1 (Form Language):** AI verifies that key labels on the feedback form (e.g., "Name", "Email", "Comments", "Rating", "Submit" button) are in the selected language (English) by checking `innerText` or `textContent`.
*   **AIVO2 (Submission & Confirmation):**
    *   AI fills the form fields with test data.
    *   AI clicks the submit button.
    *   AI verifies the appearance of a success message element containing expected text in the selected language (e.g., "Thank you for your feedback!").
*   **AIVO3 (Data Persistence Check - Conceptual):** The successful submission confirmation serves as an indirect UI-level check of persistence. If a "View my past feedback" feature existed (out of scope for MVP), it could be checked directly.

**Verification Method:** AI interacts with the DOM to select language, navigate to the feedback form, input data into form fields, and click the submit button. It then inspects the DOM for a success message in the correct language by checking `innerText` or `textContent` of the relevant HTML element.
