# High-Level Acceptance Test: HLT_001_Language_Switching

## 1. Test ID
HLT_001

## 2. Description
This test verifies that a user can successfully select a supported language (e.g., Hindi) from a language switcher, and the entire UI (menus, buttons, labels, content) immediately updates to the selected language. Subsequent navigation and interactions should continue in the chosen language until it is changed again. This test covers a core accessibility and usability feature as defined in [`PRD.md:14`](docs/PRD.md:14) and [`PRD.md:58`](docs/PRD.md:58).

## 3. Preconditions
*   The AgriConnect web application is deployed and accessible in a test environment.
*   The language switcher UI element is present and visible on the application's pages (e.g., in the header or footer).
*   At least two languages are configured and supported by the application (e.g., English and Hindi), including UI translations and sample content.

## 4. Steps

1.  **Navigate to Application:** Open a web browser and navigate to the AgriConnect application's home page.
2.  **Observe Default Language:** Note the current language of the UI elements (e.g., menu items, button texts, page titles). Assume it defaults to English or the browser's preferred language if supported.
3.  **Locate Language Switcher:** Identify and locate the language switcher component on the page.
4.  **Select New Language:** Interact with the language switcher and select a different supported language (e.g., Hindi).
5.  **Verify Immediate UI Update:** Observe if all visible UI text elements (menus, buttons, labels, static content on the current page) change to the selected language (Hindi) immediately or within a few seconds.
6.  **Navigate to Another Page:** Navigate to a different section of the application (e.g., Marketplace, Crop Advisory).
7.  **Verify Language Persistence:** Confirm that the UI elements and content on the new page are displayed in the selected language (Hindi).
8.  **Switch Back to Original Language (Optional):** Use the language switcher to select the original language (e.g., English).
9.  **Verify UI Reverts:** Confirm that the UI elements and content revert to the original language (English).

## 5. Expected Results

*   **ER1:** Upon selecting a new language (e.g., Hindi), all visible UI text elements on the current page update to display in Hindi.
*   **ER2:** Navigating to other pages within the application maintains the selected language (Hindi) for all UI elements and content.
*   **ER3:** The application correctly renders text in the selected language, considering character sets and text direction if applicable (though for initial languages like Hindi/English, directionality is LTR).
*   **ER4 (Optional):** Switching back to the original language (e.g., English) successfully updates all UI elements and content to English.
*   **ER5:** The selected language preference should ideally persist across sessions (e.g., using local storage or user profile setting if logged in), though this specific persistence mechanism might be a more detailed test. For this HLT, persistence within the current session is key.

## 6. AI Verifiable Outcome

*   **AIVO1 (Language Switch Success):** After Step 4, an AI can verify that specific, predefined UI elements (e.g., main navigation links, a prominent button label like "Login" or "Submit") now display text in the target language (e.g., Hindi equivalent "लॉग इन करें"). This can be done by checking the `innerText` or `textContent` of these elements.
*   **AIVO2 (Language Persistence on Navigation):** After Step 6, an AI can verify that the same predefined UI elements on the new page also display text in the target language (Hindi).
*   **AIVO3 (Content Language Check):** An AI can check a sample piece of static content (e.g., a section heading or a short descriptive paragraph known to have translations) on a page to confirm its text is in the selected language.
*   **AIVO4 (Language Revert Success - Optional):** If Step 8 is performed, an AI can verify that the predefined UI elements revert to the original language's text (e.g., "Login").

**Verification Method:** AI interacts with the browser DOM to inspect text content of specified HTML elements. It compares the retrieved text against expected translated strings for key UI components.
