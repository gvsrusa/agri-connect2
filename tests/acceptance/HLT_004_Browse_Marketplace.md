# High-Level Acceptance Test: HLT_004_Browse_Marketplace

## 1. Test ID
HLT_004

## 2. Description
This test verifies that a user (logged in or anonymous, depending on PRD allowance for browsing) can browse available produce listings posted by other farmers on the dedicated marketplace page. Listings should be displayed in the user's selected language. This covers the requirement from [`PRD.md:17`](docs/PRD.md:17).

## 3. Preconditions
*   The AgriConnect web application is deployed and accessible.
*   The marketplace feature is implemented and accessible.
*   There are existing crop listings in the database, created by other users, with details in various supported languages (or at least with data that can be displayed alongside translated labels).
*   The application supports language selection.

## 4. Steps

1.  **Navigate to Application:** Open a web browser and navigate to the AgriConnect application's home page.
2.  **Select Language (e.g., Marathi):** Use the language switcher to select a supported language (e.g., Marathi). Verify UI updates.
3.  **Navigate to Marketplace:** Click on the "Marketplace" or equivalent menu item/link (label should be in Marathi).
4.  **Observe Marketplace Page:**
    *   Verify that the marketplace page title and static UI elements (e.g., filter labels, sort options if any) are displayed in Marathi.
    *   Observe the list of crop listings.
5.  **Inspect Listings:** For a few sample listings:
    *   Verify that information like crop type, quantity, price, and seller information (if displayed) is presented clearly.
    *   Verify that labels associated with listing details (e.g., "Crop:", "Price:") are in Marathi.
    *   (If data itself is multilingual, verify its display; otherwise, verify labels around potentially English/numeric data).
6.  **Test Pagination (if applicable):** If there are many listings and pagination is implemented, navigate to the next page and verify listings are still displayed correctly in Marathi.
7.  **Test Filtering/Sorting (if applicable):** If filtering or sorting options are available (e.g., by crop type, location, price):
    *   Apply a filter or sort option (UI for these options should be in Marathi).
    *   Verify that the displayed listings update according to the selected criteria and are still presented correctly in Marathi.

## 5. Expected Results

*   **ER1:** The user can successfully navigate to the marketplace page.
*   **ER2:** All static UI elements on the marketplace page (titles, labels, button texts for filters/sort) are displayed in the selected language (Marathi).
*   **ER3:** Crop listings are displayed in a clear, understandable format.
*   **ER4:** Labels for details within each listing (e.g., "Crop Type:", "Quantity:", "Price:") are in the selected language (Marathi).
*   **ER5 (if applicable):** Pagination, filtering, and sorting functionalities work as expected, and the results are displayed correctly in the selected language.
*   **ER6:** The marketplace should be viewable by non-logged-in users as per general accessibility, unless explicitly restricted in detailed design. (PRD [`docs/PRD.md:17`](docs/PRD.md:17) implies general browsing).

## 6. AI Verifiable Outcome

*   **AIVO1 (Marketplace Page Language):** AI verifies that key static UI elements on the marketplace page (e.g., page title "Marketplace", filter/sort button labels) are in the selected language (Marathi) by checking `innerText` or `textContent`.
*   **AIVO2 (Listing Card Labels Language):** For a sample listing card, AI verifies that predefined labels (e.g., the text preceding the crop name, quantity, price) are in Marathi.
    *   Example: AI checks for "पीक:" (Crop: in Marathi) before the crop name.
*   **AIVO3 (Presence of Listings):** AI verifies that at least one crop listing item/card is present in the DOM, indicating that data is being loaded and displayed.
*   **AIVO4 (Pagination Functionality - if applicable):**
    *   AI clicks the "Next Page" button (identified by its Marathi label or a consistent selector).
    *   AI verifies that new listing items are loaded (e.g., by checking that the content of the first listing is different from the first listing on the previous page).
*   **AIVO5 (Filtering/Sorting Functionality - if applicable):**
    *   AI selects a filter/sort option (e.g., clicks a "Sort by Price" button with a Marathi label).
    *   AI verifies that the order or content of displayed listings changes in an expected way (e.g., prices are now ascending/descending, or only specific crop types are shown). The verification of "correctness" of sort/filter might be complex, but verifying a *change* and continued language consistency is feasible.

**Verification Method:** AI interacts with the DOM to select language, navigate, and identify elements. It checks `innerText` or `textContent` of titles, labels, and button texts against expected Marathi strings. It also checks for the presence of listing elements and can perform basic checks on pagination/filtering by observing changes in displayed data.
