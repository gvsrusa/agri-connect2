# Feature Overview Specification: Crop Advisory & Post-Harvest Guidance

## 1. Feature Name
Crop Advisory & Post-Harvest Guidance

## 2. Feature Goal
To provide farmers with accessible, practical, and localized information on crop management (covering pests, diseases, and climate adaptation strategies) and post-harvest best practices. The aim is to help farmers improve their agricultural yields and significantly reduce post-harvest losses, thereby enhancing their livelihoods. This information will be delivered through easy-to-read web pages, available in multiple local languages.

    *   Content to be categorized by:
        *   Crop type (e.g., Wheat, Rice, Cotton, Tomato)
        *   Problem type (e.g., Pest, Disease, Nutrient Deficiency, Climate Stress)
        *   Specific issue (e.g., Whitefly, Blight, Heat Stress)

## 7. UI/UX Considerations

*   **UI/UX 7.1**: Clear and prominent navigation links to "Crop Advisory" and "Post-Harvest Guidance" sections.
*   **UI/UX 7.2**: Within each section, content should be browsable using intuitive categories (e.g., by crop, by problem type for advisory; by crop, by practice for post-harvest).
*   **UI/UX 7.3**: A simple, visible search bar within these sections. Search results should clearly indicate the topic and a brief snippet.
*   **UI/UX 7.4**: Content pages must prioritize readability:
    *   Large, clear fonts.
    *   Good contrast between text and background.
    *   Adequate spacing between lines and paragraphs.
    *   Use of headings, subheadings, and bullet points to break up text.
*   **UI/UX 7.5**: Responsive design is crucial for optimal viewing on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39))
*   **UI/UX 7.6**: Images and simple diagrams should be used to supplement text where they can improve understanding, ensuring they are optimized for fast loading.
*   **UI/UX 7.7**: Language selection should be persistent and clearly indicated. Content should automatically display in the user's chosen language. ([`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48))
*   **UI/UX 7.8**: Consideration for offline caching of previously viewed content to allow access in areas with intermittent connectivity (leveraging PWA capabilities if developed, or browser caching). ([`docs/PRD.md:37`](docs/PRD.md:37))
*   **UI/UX 7.9**: Minimalistic design, avoiding clutter, to ensure focus on the content. ([`docs/PRD.md:55`](docs/PRD.md:55))

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

*   **AC 8.1**: A farmer can select "Crop Advisory," browse by "Pests," select their crop (e.g., "Tomato"), find an advisory on "Early Blight," and read the information in their selected language (e.g., Hindi). ([`docs/PRD.md:62`](docs/PRD.md:62))
*   **AC 8.2**: A farmer can select "Post-Harvest Guidance," browse by crop (e.g., "Onion"), find an article on "Proper Storage Techniques," and understand the guidance in their selected language (e.g., Marathi).
*   **AC 8.3**: A farmer can use the search bar within "Crop Advisory" to search for "water saving" and find relevant articles on climate adaptation or irrigation techniques in their selected language.
*   **AC 8.4**: All advisory and guidance content pages are readable and navigable on a small mobile screen (e.g., 360px width) without horizontal scrolling for main content.
*   **AC 8.5**: An administrator can log in to the content management interface, add a new pest advisory for "Rice" in English, and then add its Hindi translation. This new advisory becomes visible to users.
*   **AC 8.6**: When a user switches their preferred language (e.g., from English to Telugu) via the application's language switcher, the titles and content of advisory/guidance pages are displayed in Telugu.

## 9. Scope

### In Scope:
*   Providing read-only access to crop advisory information (pests, diseases, climate adaptation).
*   Providing read-only access to post-harvest guidance (handling, storage).
*   Content categorization and basic search functionality.
*   Multi-language support for all content.
*   Responsive web design for content display.
*   A mechanism for administrators to manage (CRUD) content and its translations.
*   Storing content in Supabase or a headless CMS.

### Out of Scope (for MVP of this specific module):
*   User-generated content or forums for advisory.
*   Personalized advisory based on specific farm data (beyond general regional considerations if content is structured that way).
*   Real-time alerts or notifications for new advisories (may be a future enhancement - [`docs/PRD.md:88`](docs/PRD.md:88)).
*   Complex AI-driven diagnostics or advisory (e.g., image recognition for pests - [`docs/PRD.md:52`](docs/PRD.md:52), [`docs/PRD.md:83`](docs/PRD.md:83)).
*   Integration with external advisory services via API in real-time (content is managed within the platform).
*   Offline content creation or editing by users.
*   Video or interactive multimedia content beyond simple images/diagrams in MVP.

## 10. Dependencies

*   **User Authentication & Language Selection Module**: This feature relies on the user's selected language preference being available from the user's profile, managed by the authentication and language selection system. ([`docs/PRD.md:14`](docs/PRD.md:14), [`docs/PRD.md:15`](docs/PRD.md:15), [`docs/PRD.md:27`](docs/PRD.md:27))
*   **Content Management System/Strategy**: A robust way to input, translate, and manage the advisory and guidance content is required. This could be custom-built tables in Supabase with an admin interface, or integration with a headless CMS. ([`docs/PRD.md:36`](docs/PRD.md:36))
*   **UI Framework (Next.js, Tailwind CSS)**: The presentation of content will depend on the established UI components and styling guidelines. ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:42`](docs/PRD.md:42))
*   **Database (Supabase)**: For storing structured content if not using a separate CMS. ([`docs/PRD.md:36`](docs/PRD.md:36), [`docs/PRD.md:47`](docs/PRD.md:47))
*   **Source of Agricultural Knowledge**: Reliable and accurate information for crop advisories and post-harvest practices needs to be curated or sourced from agricultural experts/institutions.
