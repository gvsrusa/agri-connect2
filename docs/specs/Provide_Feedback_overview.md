# Feature Overview Specification: Provide Feedback

## 1. Feature Name
Provide Feedback

## 2. Feature Goal
To allow users to submit feedback about the AgriConnect web application's usability and content, enabling continuous improvement of the platform.

## 3. User Stories
Derived from the AgriConnect User Blueprint ([`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)):
*   As a user, I want to easily find a way to submit feedback about my experience with the application so that my voice can be heard and improvements can be made.
*   As a user, I want to be able to provide textual comments about what I liked, disliked, or any issues I encountered, so I can give specific details.
*   As a user, I might want to give a simple rating (e.g., a star rating) for my overall satisfaction or specific aspects of the application, for a quick way to express my opinion.
*   As a user, I want the feedback form and any related messages to be in my preferred language, so I can understand and interact with it easily. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:23`](docs/PRD.md:23))

## 4. Functional Requirements
*   **FR1:** The system must provide a clearly accessible feedback mechanism (e.g., a form) for users.
*   **FR2:** The feedback form interface, including all labels, instructions, buttons, and confirmation messages, must be displayed in the user's currently selected language for the application. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:23`](docs/PRD.md:23))
*   **FR3:** The system must allow users to input and submit textual comments. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:23`](docs/PRD.md:23))
*   **FR4:** The system should (optional for MVP, desirable) allow users to submit a quantitative rating (e.g., a 1-5 star rating) regarding their experience. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:23`](docs/PRD.md:23))
*   **FR5:** Upon submission, the system must store the feedback data, including textual comments, any rating provided, a timestamp, the language of submission, and the user's ID (if authenticated). (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:34`](docs/PRD.md:34), [`docs/PRD.md:36`](docs/PRD.md:36))
*   **FR6:** If the user is authenticated (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:46`](docs/PRD.md:46)), the submitted feedback must be associated with their user account.
*   **FR7:** The system must display a confirmation message to the user in their selected language upon successful feedback submission.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **NFR1: Usability:**
    *   The feedback mechanism must be easy to locate and access within the application (e.g., link in footer/menu).
    *   The feedback form itself must be simple, intuitive, and non-intrusive, requiring minimal effort from the user. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md) Section 5)
*   **NFR2: Accessibility:**
    *   The feedback form and its elements must comply with basic web accessibility standards to be usable by individuals with low-literacy or low-tech skills. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48))
    *   Content must be clearly legible and interactive elements easily operable.
*   **NFR3: Reliability:**
    *   Submitted feedback must be reliably captured and stored in the database ([`docs/PRD.md:36`](docs/PRD.md:36)) without loss or corruption.
*   **NFR4: Performance:**
    *   The feedback form should load quickly and submissions should be processed efficiently, even on lower bandwidth connections. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:3`](docs/PRD.md:3))
*   **NFR5: Localization:**
    *   All user-facing text elements related to the feedback feature (labels, placeholders, messages) must be fully localizable and rendered in the user's selected language. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:23`](docs/PRD.md:23))
*   **NFR6: Privacy:**
    *   User identification linked to feedback should be handled according to the application's privacy policy. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:49`](docs/PRD.md:49))

## 6. Data Requirements
The following data elements need to be captured and stored for each feedback submission (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:34`](docs/PRD.md:34), [`docs/PRD.md:36`](docs/PRD.md:36)):
*   `feedback_id`: Unique identifier for the feedback entry.
*   `user_id`: Foreign key referencing the user's profile (if authenticated and logged in). Nullable if anonymous feedback is permitted in the future (not for MVP as per [`docs/PRD.md:46`](docs/PRD.md:46)).
*   `comments`: Textual feedback provided by the user (string, potentially lengthy).
*   `rating`: Numerical rating (e.g., integer 1-5), if implemented. Nullable.
*   `submission_timestamp`: Date and time when the feedback was submitted (timestamp with time zone).
*   `language_code`: The language code (e.g., 'en', 'hi') of the application interface at the time of submission.
*   `user_agent`: (Optional, for context) Browser/device information of the user.
*   `page_context`: (Optional, for context) The page or section of the application from which feedback was initiated.

## 7. UI/UX Considerations
*   **Access Point:** A persistent and easily discoverable link/button for "Provide Feedback" or similar, potentially located in the application's main navigation menu, footer, or a user settings/profile area.
*   **Form Design:**
    *   Keep the form simple and focused. Avoid unnecessary fields.
    *   Use clear, concise labels for input fields, in the user's selected language.
    *   Provide a sufficiently large text area for comments.
    *   If ratings are included, use an intuitive input method (e.g., clickable stars).
    *   Ensure the form is responsive and displays well on various screen sizes. (Ref: [`docs/PRD.md:3`](docs/PRD.md:3))
*   **Submission Process:**
    *   Clear "Submit" button.
    *   Upon successful submission, display a polite and reassuring confirmation message (e.g., "Thank you for your feedback! It has been received.") in the user's language.
    *   Consider what happens after submission (e.g., close a modal, redirect slightly, or stay on page with confirmation).
*   **Non-Intrusiveness:** The feedback option should be available but not obtrusive to the primary user flows.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
*   **AC1:** A user can locate and open the feedback submission form from a designated access point (e.g., a link in the footer).
*   **AC2:** All text elements (labels, placeholders, button text) on the feedback form are displayed in the user's currently selected application language.
*   **AC3:** A user can type and submit textual comments via the feedback form.
*   **AC4:** (If rating is implemented for MVP) A user can select and submit a rating.
*   **AC5:** Upon clicking "Submit," the feedback data (including comments, rating if applicable, user ID if authenticated, submission timestamp, and language code) is successfully saved to the Supabase database.
*   **AC6:** After successful submission, the user sees a confirmation message displayed in their selected language.
*   **AC7:** If an authenticated user submits feedback, their user ID is correctly associated with the feedback record in the database.

## 9. Scope
### In Scope (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)
*   A simple, web-based feedback form accessible within the application.
*   Ability for users to submit textual comments.
*   The feedback form interface (labels, buttons, etc.) and confirmation messages are rendered in the user's selected language.
*   Storage of submitted feedback (textual comments, user ID if authenticated, submission timestamp, language of submission) in the Supabase database for administrator review.
*   Basic validation (e.g., comment field cannot be empty if it's the only input).

### Out of Scope (MVP)
*   Direct in-app responses or dialogues with users based on their feedback.
*   Public display of submitted feedback.
*   Advanced feedback analytics or reporting dashboards visible to users or general administrators within the application.
*   Automated actions, notifications, or ticket creation based on feedback content.
*   File attachments (e.g., screenshots) with feedback.
*   Categorization of feedback by users.

### Potential Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
*   Implementation of a simple rating system (e.g., 1-5 stars) if not included in MVP.
*   Allowing users to categorize their feedback (e.g., bug report, suggestion, compliment).
*   Admin interface for viewing, managing, and tracking feedback.
*   Contextual feedback (e.g., ability to provide feedback on a specific page or feature directly).

## 10. Dependencies
