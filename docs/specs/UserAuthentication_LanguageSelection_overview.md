# Feature Overview Specification: User Authentication & Language Selection

## 1. Feature Name
User Authentication & Language Selection

## 2. Feature Goal
To enable users to select their preferred language for the application interface and content, and to securely register and authenticate their identity to access personalized features of the AgriConnect platform.

## 3. User Stories
Derived from the AgriConnect User Blueprint ([`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md:1)):

*   **US1**: As a new user, I want to select my preferred language (e.g., Hindi, Marathi, English) when I first visit the site so that I can understand and use the application easily.
*   **US2**: As a registered user, I want to be able to change my language preference in my account settings so that the application consistently uses my chosen language.
*   **US3**: As a new user, I want to be able to register for an account using my phone number, Google account, or email/password so that I can choose the most convenient and secure method for me.
*   **US4**: As a returning user, I want to be able to log in securely using my chosen authentication method to access my account and personalized information.
*   **US5**: As a user, I want my chosen language preference to be remembered and automatically applied for my subsequent sessions after I log in.
*   **US6**: As a user, I want the registration and login process to be clear and simple, presented in my selected language, to avoid confusion.

## 4. Scope
### In Scope:
*   Initial language support for Hindi, Marathi, and English.
*   A clearly visible and accessible language switcher.
*   Persistence of language preference for new visitors (e.g., via local storage/cookie before login) and registered users (in user profile).
*   Integration with Clerk/NextAuth for user authentication.
*   Support for registration and login via Google, phone number, and email/password.
*   Storage of preferred language in the user's profile (Supabase).
*   Dynamic updating of UI text and labels based on selected language.
*   Basic user profile creation to store language preference and authentication details.

### Out of Scope (for this specific feature iteration):
*   Support for additional languages beyond Hindi, Marathi, English (though the system should be extensible).
*   Complex profile management beyond basic info and language preference.
*   Role-based access control (RBAC) beyond basic authenticated vs. unauthenticated states.
*   Two-factor authentication (2FA) beyond what Clerk/NextAuth provides by default for the chosen methods.
*   Full UI localization for all application content (e.g., dynamic content like marketplace listings will depend on input language, but UI chrome will be localized).

## 5. Functional Requirements
*   **FR1**: The system must allow users to select their preferred language from a list of supported languages (initially Hindi, Marathi, English) ([`docs/PRD.md:3`](docs/PRD.md:3), [`docs/PRD.md:14`](docs/PRD.md:14), [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48)).
*   **FR2**: The system must display a language switcher that is easily accessible (e.g., in the header or footer of the application) ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48)).
*   **FR3**: The system must persist the user's chosen language preference. For unauthenticated users, this may be stored locally (e.g., browser local storage). For authenticated users, it must be stored in their user profile in Supabase ([`docs/PRD.md:27`](docs/PRD.md:27), [`docs/PRD.md:36`](docs/PRD.md:36), [`docs/PRD.md:58`](docs/PRD.md:58)).
*   **FR4**: Upon language selection, the entire application UI (menus, buttons, labels, static informational content) must update to display text in the selected language ([`docs/PRD.md:58`](docs/PRD.md:58)).
*   **FR5**: The system must integrate with Clerk/NextAuth for user registration and login functionalities ([`docs/PRD.md:15`](docs/PRD.md:15), [`docs/PRD.md:46`](docs/PRD.md:46)).
*   **FR6**: Supported authentication methods must include:
    *   Google OAuth
    *   Phone number (e.g., OTP-based)
    *   Email and password ([`docs/PRD.md:15`](docs/PRD.md:15))
*   **FR7**: The system must securely store user authentication credentials (managed by Clerk/NextAuth) and link the preferred language to the user's profile stored in Supabase ([`docs/PRD.md:27`](docs/PRD.md:27), [`docs/PRD.md:36`](docs/PRD.md:36)).
*   **FR8**: User registration and login interface elements (forms, buttons, messages) must be presented in the currently selected UI language ([`docs/PRD.md:59`](docs/PRD.md:59)).
*   **FR9**: The system shall provide clear error messages in the selected language for failed login or registration attempts.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **NFR1: Security**:
    *   User authentication processes must be secure, leveraging the security features of Clerk/NextAuth ([`docs/PRD.md:15`](docs/PRD.md:15), [`docs/PRD.md:46`](docs/PRD.md:46)).
    *   User personal data, including contact details and language preference, must be handled privately and securely in compliance with data privacy best practices ([`docs/PRD.md:49`](docs/PRD.md:49)).
    *   Passwords (if using email/password auth) must be securely hashed and salted (handled by Clerk/NextAuth).
*   **NFR2: Usability**:
    *   The language switcher must be clearly visible, intuitive, and easy to use for all users, including those with low digital literacy ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48)).
    *   Registration and login processes must be simple, straightforward, and minimize user effort ([`docs/PRD.md:7`](docs/PRD.md:7), [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48), [`docs/PRD.md:53`](docs/PRD.md:53)).
    *   The UI for authentication and language selection must be clean, uncluttered, and use large, high-contrast text and buttons ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:55`](docs/PRD.md:55)).
*   **NFR3: Accessibility**:
    *   The language switcher and authentication forms must be easily discoverable and operable via keyboard and assistive technologies, adhering to WCAG AA guidelines where feasible ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48)).
    *   The application must effectively support local languages, ensuring readability and comprehension ([`docs/PRD.md:3`](docs/PRD.md:3), [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48)).
*   **NFR4: Performance**:
    *   Language switching should be responsive, with the UI updating to the new language in under 1 second ([`docs/PRD.md:58`](docs/PRD.md:58)).
    *   Authentication responses (registration, login, logout) should be processed and confirmed to the user within 3 seconds under normal network conditions.
*   **NFR5: Maintainability**:
    *   Localization strings for UI elements must be managed in a structured way (e.g., resource files per language) to facilitate easy updates and addition of new languages ([`docs/PRD.md:35`](docs/PRD.md:35), [`docs/PRD.md:36`](docs/PRD.md:36)).
*   **NFR6: Responsiveness**:
    *   All UI elements related to language selection and authentication must be fully responsive and function correctly on various devices and screen sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones) ([`docs/PRD.md:3`](docs/PRD.md:3), [`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:42`](docs/PRD.md:42), [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48)).
*   **NFR7: Extensibility**:
    *   The language selection mechanism should be designed to easily accommodate additional languages in the future ([`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48), [`docs/PRD.md:90`](docs/PRD.md:90)).

## 7. Data Requirements
*   **DR1: User Profile Data** ([`docs/PRD.md:27`](docs/PRD.md:27)):
    *   User ID (Primary Key, managed by Clerk/NextAuth and synchronized with Supabase).
    *   Authentication credentials (securely managed by Clerk/NextAuth).
    *   Preferred language (e.g., 'en', 'hi', 'mr') - Stored in the Supabase user profile table.
    *   Basic user information (e.g., name, if provided during signup) - Stored in Supabase user profile.
    *   Timestamps for creation and last update.
*   **DR2: Localization Strings** ([`docs/PRD.md:35`](docs/PRD.md:35)):
    *   A structured collection (e.g., JSON files per language) of key-value pairs for all UI labels, button texts, messages, and other static textual content.
    *   Keys will be consistent across languages, with values providing the translation for each supported language (Hindi, Marathi, English). Example: `{"login_button": {"en": "Login", "hi": "लॉग इन करें", "mr": "लॉग इन करा"}}`.

## 8. UI/UX Considerations
*   **UIX1**: A prominent and intuitive language switcher (e.g., dropdown menu or clearly labeled buttons) should be consistently available in the application header or footer on all pages, accessible before and after login ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48)).
*   **UIX2**: Registration and login forms should be clear, simple, and minimize the number of required fields. Instructions and labels should be in the currently selected language ([`docs/PRD.md:16`](docs/PRD.md:16) (general principle), [`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:53`](docs/PRD.md:53)).
*   **UIX3**: Visual feedback (e.g., loading indicators) should be provided during language switching and authentication processes. Success and error messages should be clear and displayed in the selected language.
*   **UIX4**: The design of authentication pages (login, registration, password reset) must be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:42`](docs/PRD.md:42)).
*   **UIX5**: The selected language must be consistently applied across all UI elements, including menus, navigation, form labels, button text, and informational messages ([`docs/PRD.md:58`](docs/PRD.md:58)).
*   **UIX6**: The UI should utilize minimal text where possible, supplemented by intuitive icons, to aid users with lower literacy levels ([`docs/PRD.md:48`](docs/PRD.md:48)).
*   **UIX7**: The overall visual style for these features should align with the AgriConnect brand: simple, clean, friendly, with a farm-friendly aesthetic, implemented using Tailwind CSS ([`docs/PRD.md:39`](docs/PRD.md:39), [`docs/PRD.md:55`](docs/PRD.md:55)).
*   **UIX8**: For first-time visitors, the language selection might be presented prominently (e.g., a modal or a highly visible section) before they proceed further into the application.
