# Test Plan: User Authentication & Language Selection

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the test plan for the **User Authentication & Language Selection** feature of the AgriConnect platform. The purpose of this plan is to detail the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities. It identifies the features to be tested, the testing tasks to be performed, the personnel responsible for each task, the risks associated with the plan, and the criteria for successful completion of testing. This document will ensure that the feature meets the specified requirements and quality standards before deployment.

### 1.2 Scope of Testing

*   Language selection and persistence for both unauthenticated and authenticated users.
*   User registration via Email/Password, Google, and Phone Number.
*   User login via Email/Password, Google, and Phone Number.
*   Secure storage and retrieval of user preferences and authentication details.
*   UI responsiveness and localization accuracy.
*   Usability, accessibility, performance, and security aspects related to this feature.

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1 Test Levels & Types
A multi-layered testing approach will be adopted:

*   **Unit Testing**: Developers will perform unit testing on individual components and functions, particularly for UI components (`LanguageSwitcher`), API route handlers, and utility functions related to language preference management and Supabase interactions. Mocking will be used for external dependencies like Clerk and Supabase SDKs.
*   **Integration Testing**: Focus will be on testing the interactions between components, such as:
    *   UI components interacting with `next-intl` for translations.
    *   Frontend components interacting with Clerk SDK for authentication.
    *   Next.js API routes/server actions interacting with Supabase for profile data.
    *   Clerk webhook handling and Supabase profile synchronization.
*   **System/End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Simulates real user scenarios from start to finish. This will cover complete user flows like:
    *   New user selecting a language, registering, and verifying language persistence.
    *   Existing user logging in, changing language, and verifying persistence.
    *   Authentication flows across different methods.
    *   Automated E2E tests will be developed using a framework like Playwright or Cypress.
*   **Usability Testing**: Manual testing to evaluate the ease of use, intuitiveness of the language switcher, and clarity of the authentication process. Feedback will be gathered on UI/UX aspects.
*   **Accessibility Testing**: Manual and automated checks (e.g., Axe DevTools) to ensure compliance with WCAG AA guidelines for language switcher and authentication forms, focusing on keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
*   **Performance Testing**:
    *   Measure UI update time after language switching (target < 1 second).
    *   Measure authentication response times (target < 3 seconds).
    *   Basic load testing on authentication endpoints if feasible.
*   **Security Testing**:
    *   Verify secure handling of user credentials by Clerk.
    *   Verify RLS policies in Supabase for user profile data.
    *   Check for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF) on custom UI elements, although Clerk components are expected to be secure.
    *   Verify webhook signature validation.
*   **Localization Testing**: Verify that all UI text (labels, buttons, messages) is correctly translated and displayed for supported languages (Hindi, Marathi, English). Check for text overflow or layout issues with different languages.

### 3.2 Test Environments
*   **Development**: Local developer machines with mocked services.
*   **Staging/Testing**: A dedicated environment mirroring production as closely as possible, integrated with staging instances of Clerk and Supabase. This will be the primary environment for E2E, Usability, Accessibility, Performance, and Security testing.
*   **Production**: Post-deployment sanity checks.

### 3.3 Test Data Requirements
*   **User Accounts**:
    *   New user accounts for registration testing (Email/Password, Google, Phone).
    *   Existing user accounts with different pre-set language preferences.
    *   Test Google accounts.
    *   Test phone numbers for OTP verification (may require a test service).
*   **Language Data**:
    *   Localization files (`en.json`, `hi.json`, `mr.json`) with accurate translations.
*   **Invalid Data**:
    *   Incorrect credentials (email, password, OTP).
    *   Invalid email formats, phone numbers.

### 3.4 Entry Criteria
*   Feature development is complete and deployed to the test environment.
*   All referenced documents (spec, architecture) are stable.
*   Unit tests are completed and passing.
*   Test environment is set up and accessible.
