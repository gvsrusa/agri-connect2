# AgriConnect - Master Acceptance Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Master Acceptance Test Plan (MATP) for the AgriConnect web application. The purpose of this plan is to define the strategy, scope, and approach for conducting high-level end-to-end acceptance testing. These tests are designed to verify that the AgriConnect application meets the core requirements and user expectations as defined in the Project Requirements Document (PRD) ([`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)) and aligns with the overall project goal.

The acceptance tests are user-centric, focusing on complete system flows and integration from an external perspective. They serve as the ultimate success criteria for the project and embody the Specification phase of the SPARC framework. All tests are designed to be AI-verifiable.

## 2. Scope of Testing

The scope of acceptance testing includes all critical functionalities of the AgriConnect web application as outlined in the PRD ([`docs/PRD.md:13-24`](docs/PRD.md:13-24) and [`docs/PRD.md:57-62`](docs/PRD.md:57-62)). This encompasses:

*   **Core User Journeys:**
    *   Language selection and persistence.
    *   User authentication (signup, login, logout).
    *   Marketplace interaction (creating listings, browsing listings).
    *   Market price discovery.
    *   Accessing crop advisory content.
    *   Accessing post-harvest guidance.
    *   Requesting transportation services.
    *   Browsing available transporters.
    *   Submitting user feedback.
*   **Key Non-Functional Aspects (verified through functional flows):**
    *   Accessibility (clear UI, intuitive navigation).
    *   Responsiveness (verified by testing on different viewport emulations if possible, or assumed based on UI framework).
    *   Data integrity (e.g., listings saved correctly, prices displayed accurately).
    *   Multi-language support across all features.

**Out of Scope for MVP Acceptance Testing (as per PRD [`docs/PRD.md:50-55`](docs/PRD.md:50-55)):**
*   Full transaction or payment processing.
*   Complex AI features (e.g., advanced advisory, image recognition).
*   PWA specific offline capabilities beyond basic caching.
*   Voice input/output.

## 3. Testing Strategy

The acceptance testing strategy will employ a black-box testing approach. Each test case will simulate a real user scenario, focusing on the inputs and expected outputs without concern for the internal workings of the application.

*   **Test Levels:** High-Level End-to-End Acceptance Tests.
*   **Test Types:** User-centric scenario-based testing.
*   **Test Basis:**
    *   Project Requirements Document (PRD) - [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md)
    *   AgriConnect Research Findings - [`docs/AgriConnect_Research_Findings.md`](docs/AgriConnect_Research_Findings.md)
*   **Test Environment:** A staging or production-like environment that mirrors the live setup, including database (Supabase) and authentication (Clerk/NextAuth) integrations.
*   **AI Verifiability:** Each test case includes a specific "AI Verifiable Outcome" which describes how an AI can programmatically determine the success or failure of the test. This might involve checking for specific UI elements, API responses, or database states (where observable or inferable from UI).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

The overall AgriConnect application will be considered accepted when all defined high-level acceptance tests pass successfully. Specific pass/fail criteria are detailed within each individual test case document.

Key general criteria include:
*   All core features function as described in the PRD.
*   The application is usable and intuitive for the target farmer audience.
*   Language switching works seamlessly across the application.
*   Data entered by users is correctly processed and displayed.
*   The application adheres to the specified non-functional requirements like accessibility and responsiveness.

## 5. Test Deliverables

*   This Master Acceptance Test Plan document ([`docs/AgriConnect_Master_Acceptance_Test_Plan.md`](docs/AgriConnect_Master_Acceptance_Test_Plan.md)).
*   A suite of High-Level Acceptance Test case documents located in the `tests/acceptance/` directory. Each test case is a separate Markdown file.
*   Test execution reports (to be generated during the testing phase).

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Test Plan Creation:** AI Agent (Tester - Acceptance Plan Writer)
*   **Test Case Creation:** AI Agent (Tester - Acceptance Plan Writer)
*   **Test Execution:** AI Agent (or human tester guided by AI-verifiable steps)
*   **Defect Management:** Development Team
*   **Sign-off:** Project Stakeholders

## 7. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   A stable test environment will be available.
*   Required test data (e.g., sample user accounts, crop types, market locations) will be available or can be set up as part of test preconditions.
*   External services (Clerk/NextAuth, Supabase) are functional and accessible from the test environment.
*   The application build deployed to the test environment includes all features in scope for the current testing cycle.

## 8. High-Level Acceptance Tests (References)
